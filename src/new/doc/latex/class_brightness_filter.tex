\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Applies a brightness adjustment to the image data. 

This method iterates through each pixel in the image data and adjusts its brightness. The brightness adjustment is applied equally to all color channels (RGB) by adding a delta value to each channel. The method ensures that the final channel values remain within the 0 to 255 range. If the image data includes an alpha channel, it is left unchanged.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em data} & Pointer to the image data buffer. \\
\hline
{\em width} & The width of the image in pixels. \\
\hline
{\em height} & The height of the image in pixels. \\
\hline
{\em channels} & The number of channels in the image data (3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA). \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
